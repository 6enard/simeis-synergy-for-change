      fullStatement: "I founded Simei's Synergy for Change (SSC) not as an organization, but as a response, a response to the silent cries I saw in children without homes, families left in crisis, and communities weighed down by struggle yet forgotten by the world. On December 4th, 2023, I chose to stop watching from the sidelines and instead become part of the solution. SSC was born from a place of compassion, not convenience, a movement rooted in love, dignity, and action. From feeding the hungry on city streets to standing with children in forgotten homes and supporting less fortunate families, we have walked where others turn away. As the Founder and CEO, I do not lead from above, but alongside, ensuring that every decision, every outreach, and every effort carries the weight of purpose and the warmth of humanity. SSC is a call to everyone who believes that small acts can create great waves; it's for the forgotten, the unseen, and also for those who've always wanted to help, but didn't know how. Here, we don't just give hope, we become it."

      fullStatement: "It is my privilege and calling as the SSC Vice Chairman to be part of a movement that remains the beacon of hope and change. With the strong, visionary leadership of our Chairlady and Founder, SSC has transcended what was merely an organization to what has now become a family united in purpose, bound by compassion, motivated by service. Since our first outreach on January 27, 2024, at Mukuru Promotion Center, SSC has impacted over 150 families and made a difference in the lives of over 1,000 kids in Kenya. From the hustle of central Nairobi streets to homes in North Kajiado, from supporting communities devastated by floods, our objective has always remained the same: To be present, serve, and sow seeds of eternal transformation. Out of the countless stories we bear, one remains indelible. On 29 July, 2024, we had the privilege of enabling a girl to cross the financial divide and take her final exams. It was not merely an individual triumph but it was a reminder of what is possible when action intersects with compassion. Each visit, every hug, every meal shared are what shape the person we are. SSC is not merely touching lives, We are changing futures, one mission at a time. Come walk with us on this journey. In your volunteer service, collaboration, or support, your work becomes part of the growing tide of hope that reaches farther yet shines all the brighter. Together, we are igniting change. Together, we are SSC."

      fullStatement: "At Simei's Synergy for Change, being Vice Chairs is not about titles, it's about service. It's about standing in the gap when it matters most, showing up with heart, and making sure no one feels forgotten. Every time we step into a home, a street corner, a household, a village, or a room full of children, we are reminded why this foundation exists: to restore dignity, to remind people they are seen, and to be present in moments others overlook. We've seen firsthand what it means to offer hope, not as a handout, but as a hand to hold. And that's what SSC is: a living, breathing community built on real people doing real work that touches real lives. We are proud to walk alongside Trevor, our team, and every volunteer and supporter who believes, like we do, that kindness still has the power to change the world. Our promise as Vice Chairs is simple: to lead with compassion, to listen more than we speak, and to always carry the mission of SSC with humility and purpose. We may not have all the answers, but together, with faith, action, and love, we are creating them, one step at a time."

Finance in a charitable foundation isn't just about balancing books; it's about ensuring that every coin is accounted for, every resource is maximized, and every contribution is treated with the respect it deserves. I joined SSC because I believed in its heartbeat, a genuine desire to uplift and change lives, and my responsibility is to ensure that this mission is not only sustainable, but also transparent and accountable. Through clear reporting, ethical budgeting, and strategic stewardship, I work every day to make sure that the financial backbone of SSC remains strong, honest, and deeply aligned with the purpose it was built on."

We've been entrusted with ensuring that every part of our work, from how we handle finances to how we run our programs, stays true to the laws, values, and ethics that define us. Our foundation is built on transparency, accountability, and integrity, and it's our job to make sure those values aren't just words on paper, but real in every decision, every partnership, and every action. We work behind the scenes to build trust, not just with donors and partners, but also with the communities we serve and the team we work alongside. That means setting up strong internal systems, regularly reviewing our processes, and making sure we're doing things right, not just fast. For us, compliance isn't about ticking boxes, it's about protecting the mission, ensuring long term impact, and doing right by the people who believe in us. Whether we're overseeing a local outreach or managing global partnerships, we're always asking: Are we honoring the trust placed in us? Are we using every resource responsibly? Our work is a quiet promise, that behind every smile we help create, there's a structure of honesty, care, and responsibility holding it up. That's what drives us, every single day."
